                The most traditional wine among Argentines is red , full- bodied and very astringent . Due to its color
                it is colloquially called quebracho , in allusion to Schinopsis balansae , a southern tree with reddish
                wood and, like red wines, rich precisely in tannins . In the second half of the 20th century , the
                country's middle classes favored the so-called " rosé wines ", with an intermediate bouquet between the
                intense and harsh red wines (popularly called by the locals: " totíns " or " tintardos ") and the softer
                " clarets "."Italian type, or even the very smooth on the palate (although sometimes with a high alcohol
                content ) white wines . Also, at a similar time, common white wines became general among the population;
                such a generalization entailed a negligent elaboration, of which The excellent and original Torrontés
                wines, with a honey color , pleasant and fruity taste, excellent aroma and quite strong alcoholic
                degree, were freed.
                <Br />
                Due to its mesology , and especially to the combination of heliophany (high) and edaphology (soils poor
                in moisture but rich in condensed organic matter ), the grapes produced in the Andean and foothills of
                Argentina are very rich in glucose , giving result in excellent ethanol , in turn enriched as well as
                balanced by its flavonoids . Its polyphenols also contribute to this balance .

                    alt="uva cabernet franc">
                <p>In general, Cabernet Franc is very similar to Cabernet Sauvignon, but it sprouts and matures at least
                    a week earlier. This allows the vine to adapt to slightly cooler climates than those of Cabernet
                    Sauvignon, such as those in the Loire Valley.
                    Their early budding makes them susceptible to viticulture hazards such as coulure early in the
                    growing season. The vine is vigorous and upright, with dark skin and five-lobed leaves. The
                    clusters are elongated and small or medium in size. The grapes are very small and dark blue in
                    color, with thin skins. 2Cabernet Franc is more prone to mutation than Cabernet Sauvignon, but less
                    so than Pinot Noir.
                    <Br />
                    Cabernet Franc can adapt to a wide variety of soils but can thrive on sandy and chalky soils,
                    producing heavier, fuller-bodied wines there. In the Loire Valley, the terroir contributes
                    differences between the wines that can be perceived between the grapes that have grown on gravel
                    terraces or on tuff slopes. The grape can produce high yields, producing overgrown wines with more
                    green herbal notes.

                <p>Syrah plantations in Argentina have increased from less than 1,000 ha in 1990 to 9,500 ha in 2002.
                    In Argentina, Syrah is often blended with the dark-skinned Malbec grape to give an Argentine option
                    to Australian Cabernet-Shiraz. This has gained a new place in Argentina, where wines with a lighter
                    and fresher style are being produced. The most suitable areas for this variety are Mendoza and San
                    Juan, where its purity is maintained, thanks to its intense sun. In these areas, 90% of the hectares
                    planted with this variety in the country are concentrated, which add up to 12,809, a lower figure
                    compared to the 200,000 hectares of vineyards planted throughout Argentina.
                    <Br />
                    Small amounts of Syrah are used for the production of various styles of wines, such as rosé wine,
                    port-style fortified wine, and sparkling red wine. Although Australian sparkling shiraz wine is
                    somewhat sweet, some Australian producers produce dry, full-bodied shiraz sparkling wine that
                    retains the complexity and sometimes earthy characteristic that can be found in still wines of that
                    variety.
                    <Br />
                    Due to their concentrated flavors and high tain levels, many premium syrahs improve after bottle
                    aging. In exceptional cases, this can last 15 years or more.
                    <Br />
                    Syrah wines are recommended to be served at 18°C. 21

                <p>Merlot is a dark blue wine grape variety, used both as a blending grape and for varietal wines. The
                    name "merlot" is believed to be a diminutive of "merle", the French name for the blackbird , likely
                    a reference to the color of the grape. Its smoothness and "meatiness", combined with its earlier
                    maturation, make Merlot a popular grape to blend with the harder, late-ripening Cabernet Sauvignon ,
                    which tends to be higher in tannins .
                    <Br />
                    Merlot grapes are identified by their loose clusters of large berries. The color is less dark blue
                    in tone than cabernet sauvignon grapes and they have thinner skin and fewer tannins per unit volume.
                    It normally matures up to two weeks before Cabernet Sauvignon. Also, compared to cabernet, merlot
                    grapes tend to have higher sugar content and less malic acid.
                    <Br />
                    In Argentina, Merlot plantings have been increasing in the Mendoza region with the grape showing an
                    affinity to the Tupungato region of the Uco Valley. Argentine Merlots grown in the higher elevations
                    of Tunpungato have shown a balance of ripe fruit, tannic structure and acidity.The grape is not
                    as widely planted here due to the natural fruity and fleshiness of the popular Malbec and Douce
                    noir/Bonarda grapes that often don't need to be "mellowed" by Merlot as Cabernet Sauvignon and
                    Cabernet Franc may benefit from. In 2008, there were 7,142 hectares (17,650 acres) of Merlot growing
                    in Argentina, most of it in the Mendoza region and in the San Juan Province.

                    alt="uva cabernet Sauvignon">
                <p>Cabernet Sauvignon leaf. In cooler climates, vines spend more energy producing foliage than producing
                    grapes, as they need it to capture sunlight for photosynthesis. This makes foliage management and
                    heavy pruning important to growers.
                    <Br />
                    Although Cabernet Sauvignon can grow in a wide variety of climates, its suitability for varietal
                    wines or as a blending component is strongly influenced by the warmth of the climate. The vine is
                    one of the last major grapes to bud and ripen (usually 1-2 weeks after Merlot and Cabernet Franc)
                    and the timing of the growing season affects when the harvest takes place.
                    <Br />
                    There are a couple of flavor notes in cabernet sauvignon that are tied to viticulture and weather
                    influences. The most widely recognized flavor is the green or herbaceous peppery flavor caused by
                    pyrazines, which are more abundant in immature grapes. Pyrazine components are present in all grapes
                    from the cabernet sauvignon vine and are gradually destroyed by sunlight as the grape ripens. This
                    component is detectable by the human palate in wines that have pyrazine levels of up to 2 nanograms
                    per liter. At veraison time, when the first grapes begin to fully ripen, there are pyrazine levels
                    of 30 ng/l. In cold climates, it is difficult for cabernet sauvignon grapes tofully mature to the
                    point where pyrazine is not detected. Green pepper flavor is not considered a wine defect, but many
                    consumers may not want it.

                <p>Malbec is a purple grape variety used to make red and white wines (Blanc de Malbec, in Argentina).
                    <Br />
                    Malbec is very susceptible to various grape diseases and viticultural risks , especially frost,
                    coulure, and midiu and rot, but the development of new clones and new viticultural techniques have
                    helped control some of these potential problems. It has the potential to produce high yields. If
                    yields are too high, as happened in Argentina with the excessive use of flood irrigation, the wines
                    become simpler and less flavorful. Malbec adapts well lto a wide variety of terroirs, but on the
                    limestone soils of Cahors it seems to produce the darkest and most tannic wines. oneThere are
                    ampelographic differences between the Malbec clones found in France and those found in Argentina, as
                    the Argentines bear smaller fruit.
                    <Br />
                    Comparative research conducted by the Catena Institute of Wine and the University of California at
                    Davis examined the differences between the phenolic composition of Malbec wines from California , in
                    the United States, and from Mendoza , in Argentina . 16 vineyards in California and 26 terraces in
                    Mendoza were selected on the basis of their uniformity and the representativeness of their regions.
                    The study concluded that there is a distinct composition of flavors between Malbec wines produced in
                    Mendoza and those produced in California.
